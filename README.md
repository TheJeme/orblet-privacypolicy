# orblet-privacypolicy

Orblet is my first game that I ever made.

I have programmed this game to NOT collect any personally identifiable information. This app doesn't send anything to anywhere nor save anything on your local files. This game is open source and is placed under MIT-License: https://github.com/TheJeme/Orblet

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely help you.

Yours sincerely
